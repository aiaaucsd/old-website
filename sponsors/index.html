		<h1>Become a Sponsor</h1>
		<p>We invite you to help and be part of our efforts to strengthen our future engineers. AIAA@UCSD is dedicated to building a strong community of aerospace engineers at UC San Diego, and preparing them for jobs after they graduate. AIAA@UCSD holds professional development events throughout the year, allowing students to meet industry professionals and see many different career paths an aerospace engineer can take.  Also, AIAA@UCSD supports design projects that give students hands-on, practical experience for the workplace.  Finally, AIAA@UCSD is involved in the community, encouraging grade school children to consider studying engineering and science.  The success and continuation of these programs requires the generosity of companies and small donors to support these efforts. AIAA@UCSD (through the Jacobs School of Engineering) is a 501(c)(3) organization and can offer donors a tax deduction.</p>
