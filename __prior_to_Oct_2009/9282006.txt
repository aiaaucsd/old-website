  - Rocketry and space are privatized = JOBS AND $ IN THE FUTURE!
  - If SDSU can with their liquid rocket project, we can have a hybrid rocket!
- What is a hybrid rocket and why?
  - Hybrid of liquid and solid technologies
  - Liquid oxidizer is sprayed down an enclosure of solid fuel
  - It's safer and less complex - it's the perfect human transfer rocket: THE WORLD IS IN DEMAND OF THIS
